## Introduction
Here are some custom monitoring scripts that I have created to use with [check_mk local checks][1]. If you don't already know what check_mk is, I wrote another [blog post][2] about it and explaining why it is currently the best open source monitoring tool for any enterprise.

Since I have started using Check_MK based monitoring solution, I have been creating custom check scripts for functions that I can't find from [Nagios Exchange][3] or [Check_MK Exchange][4]. This post will be updated as I add more custom check_mk local checks to my Github repository. All of them are free to use and you can find them [here][5].

If you don't know how or where to install these custom checks on your Check_MK enabled Nagios server, or OMD, please refer to the official documentation [here][6]. I will only be covering what these custom checks are and what their intentions are for.
